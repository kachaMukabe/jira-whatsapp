# Jira Whatsapp Cloud api connector

Open issue tickets on Jira from whatsapp messages.

This application allows an IT team to receive support messages from their WhatsApp for business account directly into a Jira project. This project uses Whatsapp cloud api to connect to a Jira forge application. When a customer sends a support request to an organisation's WhatsApp business line a web trigger automatically creates a task in a Jira project that a team can assign to anyone on the support team.
